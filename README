ChristmasTree
=============

X'mas is coming. A colleage of mine raised a software design question as follows:

		     1
	    _____|___________
		|		 		|
		2		 		3
________|_____________  |
|	 |    |          |	|
4    5	  6	         7  8
     |	__|______    |
	 |	|  |  |  |   |
	 9	10 11 12 13	14
   _________|__________
   |   |   |   |   |   |
   15  16  17  18  19  20
						  
Given the relationship of the nodes described as above.
We would like to find out the total count of nodes at a certain level
Example : what is the count of nodes at level 2 from node 1?
The answer should be 5

ChristmasTree is a PHP class intended to solve this problem.
